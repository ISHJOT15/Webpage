            <p class="sectiontag text-big">What are the Shoe Materials?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Shoe material is important for a few reasons. 
                First, different materials provide different levels of comfort, require different levels of care, and different price tags. 
                Shoe material also affects the durability and longevity of the shoes. Many people choose leather materials since 
                it is the highest-quality and easier to care for. 
                However, an array of other materials are also available, canvas and cloth being additional popular choices.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Sometimes, despite your best efforts to purchase shoes that fit properly and are 
                comfortable on the feet it just doesn’t happen. Shoes aren’t cheap, so make sure the store offers a return policy 
                before purchase. Learn the conditions of the return policy as well. The shoes cannot be worn in most cases, though 
                some stores offer refunds and exchanges; some offer an exchange only option.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">What are Other People Saying About the Shoes?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Before buying shoes online, read reviews and learn more about what other people are 
                saying about the product. Reviews reveal important information vital to a satisfying shoe purchase, giving you insight 
                into the shoe’s comfort, fit, durability, and many other important factors. Many online sites have reviews posted near 
                the product. Additionally, there are many review-type websites that have a plethora of information available for many 
                of the top brands and shoe styles.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Do I Really Need Another Pair of Shoes?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The average person owns six pairs of shoes, though some would argue the numbers are 
                much, much higher. If there are a few pairs of shoes in the closet already, ask yourself if the new pair is really 
                needed before spending the cash. Where will you wear the shoes? How often will you wear them? Will the shoes go on sale 
                in the near future? These questions are a few of the many that you should answer before ordering another pair of shoes!
